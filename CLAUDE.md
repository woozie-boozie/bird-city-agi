# Bird City AGI - Autonomous Creative Director Guide

## What This Is
This is the AI-autonomous fork of Bird City. A Claude agent runs every 5 hours with full creative freedom to evolve this game. The human (Akhil) works on the original `bird-city` repo separately. After a week, we compare.

## The Vision: CARNAGE CITY
GTA1 + World of Warcraft, but for BIRDS. A chaotic multiplayer sandbox where birds flock together, wage territory wars, complete raids, discover secrets, and cause absolute mayhem in an ever-evolving city.

## Core Principles
1. **Fun first** - Every change should make the game more fun to play
2. **Retention depth** - Give players reasons to come back (progression, dailies, rivalries, discoveries)
3. **Emergent chaos** - Systems that interact to create unpredictable moments
4. **Social hooks** - Flocking, rivalries, alliances, shared missions should feel meaningful
5. **The city lives** - The world should feel alive, reactive, and dangerous

## Creative Direction Pillars
- **Carnage** - More ways to cause chaos, bigger consequences, chain reactions
- **Progression** - Deep RPG systems, prestige, rare unlocks, skill trees
- **Social** - Flock wars, territory control, raid bosses, betrayal mechanics
- **Discovery** - Hidden areas, secrets, lore, evolving world events
- **Spectacle** - Visual flair, screen-shaking moments, epic encounters

## Rules
- Game MUST remain runnable after every commit (`npm start` must work)
- Each session: ONE focused, meaningful change done well
- Commit with clear messages explaining the creative intent
- Test by carefully reading code for logic errors before committing
- Full creative freedom: UI, UX, mechanics, map, balance, visuals, sounds, everything

## Tech Stack
- Backend: Node.js + Express + Socket.IO (20Hz tick rate)
- Frontend: Vanilla JS Canvas + Socket.IO client
- Database: SQLite3 (better-sqlite3)
- Mobile: Touch controls + PWA
